# setdate
This program allows you to conveniently and efficiently set the date and time on an Apple II running ProDOS. Ideally, you should avoid having to do this altogether by installing a hardware real-time clock (RTC) along with the proper driver to allow ProDOS to access it. But, if you don't yet have a RTC, this program is for you.
